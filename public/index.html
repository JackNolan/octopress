  <div class="entry-content"><p>At one time or another I have experienced all major ways of learning computer science self study, university classes, and the group-oriented classroom. This gives me an unique ability to examine the pros and cons of each style. Since this is a large subject I have broken it into three blog posts which should be following.</p>

<h2>Lecture Hall aka University</h2>

<p><img src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4031/4530228887_78634666ff_z.jpg" title="Lecture hall" alt="Lecture hall" /></p>

<p>No one is a stranger to the classic college formula these days: lecture on monday, test on friday. While University teaching works to educate a large number of students in a (relatively) short time, it does have a few drawbacks.</p>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Large class sizes

<ul>
<li>hard to reach professors</li>
<li>little to no sense of ‘comradery’</li>
<li>slows down the class</li>
<li>hard for professors to give meaningful feedback</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emphasis on tests

<ul>
<li>completely academic

<ul>
<li>no real world analogies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>leads to a ‘get an A’ mentality rather than a ‘learn this shit’ mentality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bureaucracy

<ul>
<li>hard for professors to change class content</li>
<li>professors tend to burn out from dealing with bureaucracy</li>
<li>leads to stagnation</li>
<li>forms, hoops, and permissions for every decision</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cost

<ul>
<li>average cost of four year degree: $21,657</li>
<li>this number increases every year</li>
<li>takes four years of your life</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focused on theory

<ul>
<li>great foundations</li>
<li>does not really prepare you to develop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Degree

<ul>
<li>an accredited university provides formal proof of completion</li>
<li>required by some organisations</li>
<li>most provide an excellent foundation in theory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>College experience

<ul>
<li>a large community leads to networking opportunites</li>
<li>achieve a working knowledge in a variety of subjects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h3>To conclude:</h3>

<p>Overall I dislike the current way computer science is taught in universities.  In the current environment it is almost impossible for professors to teach full time and keep up with the changing field of computer science. This forces a greater emphasis on theory which leads to graduates that can explain the O(n) of an algorithm they outlined, but have no idea how to launch a web server or an application.</p>

<p>Next up teaching yourself&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After completing the computer architecture course at the University of Minnesota I find myself wondering about how things work at a low level. Now at the flatiron school we are covering ruby, and I find myself wondering how the memory allocation works for ruby objects. After a bit of searching I found this <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/27174770/Garbage-Collection-and-the-Ruby-Heap">slide deck</a>that contained a very clear explanation of the behind the scenes workings of ruby; While paying special attention to memory allocation and garbage collection.</p>

<p>These slides reminded me of my final project in the architecture class where I implemented a rudimentary malloc of my own which, it turns out, works much like the allocation of memory for classes works in ruby. I wonder how hard it would be to implement this method of garbage collection on top of it&#8230; hopefully nothing good on tv next weekend!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before I started at flatiron school this semester I worked for <a href="http://www.linkup.com/">JobDig</a> writing parsers and spiders to index jobs. It was good work and a great first experience in the tech industry. However, there were a few common things I ran into on a day to day bases that I thought I would share to show potential employers some good practices when listing jobs.</p>

<p>1) Use concise html and css. Since some poor soul out there (me) may have to wade through your html and css consider consolidating your html and css both to organize your site better but to help them index your jobs. Using constant naming schemes can save them time and get your openings out to the community.</p>

<p>2) Don&#8217;t hide you employment page. Seriously, I have had to hack at the url in order to get to an employment page due to broken links or hidden job listings. By keeping it visible you make it easier for potential hires to apply for the job!</p>

<p>3) Keep it simple. Same as number two, if you over complicate your application process the great candidates and job listings sites are going to skip your site which means less candidates. If you lack the time consider using an third party ( like <a href="">Taleo</a>!) to list your jobs in a proven organised way.</p>

<p>It is in a company&#8217;s interest to have as many people as possible see their job listings. More views means more applications, which means more choice in candidates which leads to better hires! By keeping these tips in mind when designing your sites employment section you can help your potential hires find you quickly and efficiently.</p>
